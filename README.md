# Lol-Synergy-Analysys
 
Lol Synergy Analysys (yes I know it's spelled wrong) is a tool that allows you to create teams based on statistical analysis.

The team will be created all based on the champion you choose.

Example: If you choose Bard as support, the output will build a team in favor of Bard.

All you have to do is:

1) Get Champions
2) Select a champion in the box
3) Hit calculate
