# Lol-Synergy-Analysys
 
Lol Synergy Analysys (yes I know it's spelled wrong) is a tool that allows you to create teams based on statistical analysis.

The team will be created all based on the champion you choose.

Example: If you choose Bard as support, the output will build a team in favor of Bard.

All you have to do is:

1) Get Champions
2) Select a champion in the box
3) Hit calculate

No riot api key is needed, I'm using public available data.

Please note that it took me a few hours to code this program, even though I've added lots of comments to guide you through the process, it may contain bugs and unwanted errors.

Please open an issue if you find anything! Thanks :)
